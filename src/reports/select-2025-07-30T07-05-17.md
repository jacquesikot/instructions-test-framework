## Scenario 1 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Build a signup page for a global scholarship program where students select their university from over 2000 options

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (using react-window) to handle the large dataset efficiently?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The given `VirtualizedSelect` component uses the `react-window` library to efficiently render a list of items—in this case, university options. It utilizes `FixedSizeList`, which allows you to only render visible items in the list while maintaining a fixed height and item size, significantly improving performance when dealing with large datasets. This approach minimizes the number of rendered components in the DOM at any given time, thus reducing rendering overhead and improving the user experience for the selection of over 2000 universities. By passing the `items` prop and rendering only the visible items based on their indices, the component effectively implements virtualization.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const universities = []; // Assume this array is populated with over 2000 university options

const VirtualizedSelect = ({ items, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Select {...props}>
      <SelectTrigger>
        <SelectValue placeholder="Select your university" />
      </SelectTrigger>
      <SelectContent>
        <List height={300} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} itemData={items}>
          {({ index, style, data }) => (
            <div style={style}>
              <SelectItem value={data[index].value}>{data[index].label}</SelectItem>
            </div>
          )}
        </List>
      </SelectContent>
    </Select>
  );
};

const SignupPage = () => {
  const [selectedUniversity, setSelectedUniversity] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Global Scholarship Program Signup</h1>
      <VirtualizedSelect
        items={universities}
        onValueChange={setSelectedUniversity}
      />
      {/* Other signup form fields go here */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
```
