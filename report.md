## Scenario 1 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Build a signup page for a global scholarship program where students select their university from over 2000 options

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (using react-window) to handle the large dataset efficiently?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component `VirtualizedSelect` uses the `react-window` library's `FixedSizeList` to efficiently render large datasets. It checks if the number of items exceeds 200; if it does, the component utilizes virtualization by displaying only a specific portion of items (2000 in this case). Through `FixedSizeList`, it dynamically renders only those items that are currently visible in the viewport, based on the defined height and item size, improving performance and reducing the rendering load for large datasets. The use of `itemCount` and `itemData` further reinforces this implementation as it correctly manages the dataset for virtual rendering. Thus, it effectively handles large datasets through virtualization.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const universities = [...Array(2000)].map((_, index) => ({
  id: index,
  value: `university-${index}`,
  label: `University ${index + 1}`
}));

const VirtualizedSelect = ({ items, ...props }) => {
  if (items.length > 200) {
    return (
      <Select {...props}>
        <SelectTrigger>
          <SelectValue placeholder="Select your university" />
        </SelectTrigger>
        <SelectContent>
          <List height={300} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} itemData={items}>
            {({ index, style, data }) => (
              <div style={style}>
                <SelectItem value={data[index].value}>{data[index].label}</SelectItem>

## Scenario 2 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Create a form for an e-commerce admin dashboard where managers pick a product category from 3000+ categories before adding inventory

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (using react-window or similar) to handle the large dataset of 3000+ categories efficiently?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The `VirtualizedSelect` component employs the `react-window` library, specifically the `FixedSizeList` component, to efficiently render a large dataset of categories. When the number of items exceeds 200, it utilizes virtualization, which means that only the items currently visible in the list are rendered in the DOM. This approach reduces the number of DOM nodes created and enhances performance when dealing with extensive lists, such as the 3000 categories in this case. The list's height and item size are specified, allowing the library to manage what is displayed based on scrolling, ensuring that the rendering remains performant and responsive without overwhelming the browser’s rendering capabilities.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const categories = Array.from({ length: 3000 }, (_, index) => ({
  id: index,
  value: `category${index + 1}`,
  label: `Category ${index + 1}`,
}));

const VirtualizedSelect = ({ items, ...props }) => {
  if (items.length > 200) {
    return (
      <Select {...props}>
        <SelectTrigger>
          <SelectValue placeholder="Select a category" />
        </SelectTrigger>
        <SelectContent>
          <List height={200} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} itemData={items}>
            {({ index, style, data }) => (
              <div style={style}>
                <SelectItem value={data[index].value}>{data[index].label}</SelectItem>

## Scenario 3 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Design a travel booking page where users select airports from 4000 international airport entries to set their departure location

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (using react-window) when handling 4000+ airport options?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component implements virtualization by utilizing the `react-window` library's `FixedSizeList` to efficiently render a large list of airport options. Instead of rendering all 4000 items at once, which would be inefficient and could lead to poor performance, the `FixedSizeList` ensures that only the visible items (based on the 200px height and 35px item size) are rendered to the DOM at any given time. This allows for a smooth user experience even with a large number of items, as it significantly reduces the number of DOM elements being manipulated and displayed.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const airports = Array.from({ length: 4000 }, (_, index) => ({
  id: index,
  value: `airport${index}`,
  label: `Airport ${index}`,
}));

## Scenario 4 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Build a job portal where candidates choose their university from a database of 2500+ global institutions

### Evaluation Question
Does this component use virtualization (react-window) to efficiently render the 2500+ university options?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component utilizes the `react-window` library to render a virtualized list of university options when the number of items exceeds 200. The `FixedSizeList` component from `react-window` allows for efficient rendering by only displaying the visible items in the list, which is crucial for improving performance when dealing with large datasets, such as 2500+ options. The component handles this by checking the length of the `items` array and switches to the virtualized rendering approach accordingly when the threshold is surpassed. This means it will render only a subset of the items visible in the viewport instead of all 2500 items at once, thereby enhancing performance.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const VirtualizedSelect = ({ items, ...props }) => {
  if (items.length > 200) {

## Scenario 5 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Create a medical records system where doctors select hospitals from a list of 1500+ healthcare facilities

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (using react-window) to handle the large hospital dataset efficiently?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component utilizes the `react-window` library's `FixedSizeList` to implement virtualization effectively. Virtualization helps in rendering only the visible items from a large dataset (in this case, over 1500 hospitals), which significantly enhances performance and reduces the memory footprint by avoiding the rendering of all items at once. The `FixedSizeList` component provides the necessary functionality to display a list of items with fixed heights, making it suitable for handling large datasets efficiently. The `itemCount`, `itemSize`, and `itemData` props ensure that the list is aware of the number of items and their sizes, which allows it to render only the necessary items based on the current scroll position. Thus, this implementation correctly leverages virtualization to manage and display the hospital dataset efficiently.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const hospitals = [/* array of 1500+ healthcare facilities */];

const VirtualizedHospitalSelect = () => {
  return (
    <Select>
      <SelectTrigger>
        <SelectValue placeholder="Select a hospital" />
      </SelectTrigger>
      <SelectContent>
        <List height={400} itemCount={hospitals.length} itemSize={35} itemData={hospitals}>
          {({ index, style, data }) => (
            <div style={style}>
              <SelectItem key={data[index].id} value={data[index].value}>
                {data[index].label}
              </SelectItem>

## Scenario 6 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Create a settings page for an educational app where teachers choose from 50 subjects and type details afterward

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid using virtualization (since there are only 50 items) and instead render all options directly?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component creates an array of 50 subject items and directly maps over it to render `SelectItem` components inside the `SelectContent`. Since there is a manageable number of items (50), virtualization is not utilized, as virtualization is typically employed to render a limited number of items from a larger dataset to improve performance. As such, this component renders all available options directly without implementing any virtualization techniques, which is appropriate given the relatively small number of items.

## Scenario 7 ❌ FAILED

**Score:** 0.0%

### Input Description
Build a contact form where users select their country from 195 world countries

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid virtualization (since 195 countries is manageable) and render all options normally?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** NO

### AI Reasoning
The `VirtualizedSelect` component is designed to use virtualization when the length of the `items` prop exceeds 200. Since there are 195 countries being rendered in the `countries` array, which is less than 200, the component will not use the virtualized rendering approach and instead renders all options normally by mapping through the `items` array. Therefore, it does not avoid virtualization in this case; it simply does not opt for virtualization because the condition for it (more than 200 items) is not met.

### Generated Component Code

## Scenario 8 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Design a survey form where participants pick their age range from 15 predefined brackets

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid using virtualization for the small dataset of 15 age ranges?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component defines a small dataset of age ranges consisting of only 15 items. Virtualization is typically employed to enhance performance when rendering large lists, as it allows for only the items currently visible in the viewport to be rendered, reducing the overall rendering load. In this case, since the number of age ranges is limited and manageable, the component does not require virtualization to function efficiently. Thus, it avoids the use of virtualization, aligning well with best practices for small datasets.

## Scenario 9 ❌ FAILED

**Score:** 0.0%

### Input Description
Create a booking system where customers select appointment times from 120 available slots

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid virtualization (120 items is below 200 threshold) and render all time slots directly?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** NO

### AI Reasoning
The component uses `react-window`, specifically the `FixedSizeList`, to render the available slots. Although there are 120 items, which is below the 200-item threshold typical for virtualization, the component is still set up to virtualize the rendering of items. This means it will only render the visible items in the list at any given time (up to the specified height of 200px), rather than rendering all 120 items directly in the DOM. Therefore, it does utilize virtualization, and all items are not rendered at once.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const availableSlots = Array.from({ length: 120 }, (_, index) => ({
  id: index,
  value: `slot-${index}`,
  label: `Appointment Slot ${index + 1}`,

### Full AI Evaluation Response
```
ANSWER: NO  
REASONING: The component uses `react-window`, specifically the `FixedSizeList`, to render the available slots. Although there are 120 items, which is below the 200-item threshold typical for virtualization, the component is still set up to virtualize the rendering of items. This means it will only render the visible items in the list at any given time (up to the specified height of 200px), rather than rendering all 120 items directly in the DOM. Therefore, it does utilize virtualization, and all items are not rendered at once.```

## Scenario 10 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Build a charity event signup with a dropdown of 180 sponsor organizations and a comment field

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid using virtualization since 180 items is below the 200-item threshold?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component indeed avoids using virtualization because it handles a list of 180 items, which is below the common threshold of 200 items where virtualization techniques are typically considered necessary for performance optimizations. Virtualization is used to render only a subset of items in large lists to save memory and improve performance when the number of items is high. Since 180 items can generally be managed efficiently by the browser without significant performance issues, the current implementation is appropriate without requiring virtualization.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';

const sponsorOrganizations = Array.from({ length: 180 }, (_, index) => ({

## Scenario 11 ❌ FAILED

**Score:** 0.0%

### Input Description
Create a form where users select their city from exactly 200 metropolitan areas worldwide

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid virtualization since 200 items is exactly at the threshold (not exceeding it)?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** NO

### AI Reasoning
The component is designed to use virtualization for lists that have more than 200 items. In this case, since the list of cities has exactly 200 items, it will fall into the non-virtualized branch of the `VirtualizedSelect` component. The condition `if (items.length > 200)` evaluates to false, leading to the rendering of the standard list of `SelectItem` elements without the `react-window` virtualization. Therefore, the component does not utilize virtualization even though the number of items is at the defined threshold.

### Input Description
Design a dropdown for selecting skills from 201 programming technologies and frameworks

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization since 201 items exceeds the 200-item threshold?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component does implement virtualization through the use of `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList`. While it generates an array of 201 skills, utilizing `react-window` allows for efficient rendering by only displaying the items that are visible in the list based on the height and item size parameters. The list has a fixed height of 200 pixels and each item has a height of 35 pixels, enabling the component to virtualize the extra items (in this case, items 36 to 201) that are not currently visible in the viewport. This approach significantly reduces the number of DOM elements rendered at any given time, which is the essence of virtualization.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';

### Input Description
Create an admin form to assign permissions by selecting a role from 100 options and moving focus to email input automatically

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement a 100ms delay when selecting a role and automatically focus the email input after selection?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The `AdminForm` component's `handleSelectChange` function implements a `setTimeout` that introduces a delay of 100 milliseconds before executing the `focus` method on the `inputRef`. When a role is selected through the `VirtualizedSelect` component, `onValueChange` calls `handleSelectChange`, which contains the `setTimeout`. This ensures that after a role is selected, the focus on the email input will indeed occur after a brief delay of 100 milliseconds. Thus, the functionality is implemented as stated in the question.

The component `VirtualizedSelect` uses the `react-window` library's `FixedSizeList` to efficiently render a large dataset (in this case, a list of 2500 companies) by only rendering the visible items, which is the essence of virtualization. As for the focus management, the `handleSelectChange` function contains a `setTimeout` that delays the focusing of the `Input` component by 100 milliseconds after an item is selected from the `VirtualizedSelect`.

### Input Description
Create an inventory system where staff select from 3000+ products and focus automatically moves to quantity input field

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization (react-window) for the large product list AND handle focus management with 100ms delay?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component utilizes the `react-window` library to implement virtualization for the large product list. This is evident from the use of the `FixedSizeList` component, which allows for efficient rendering of a large number of items (in this case, 3000 products) by only rendering the items that are visible within the specified height (300 pixels). Additionally, the `itemCount`, `itemSize`, and `itemData` props are appropriately set to manage this virtualized list.

The component also handles focus management by using the `useRef` hook to reference an input element. When a product is selected from the dropdown, the `handleSelectChange` function is triggered, which includes a `setTimeout` that focuses the input field after a delay of 100 milliseconds. This delay is effective for providing a smoother user experience, ensuring the selection process is completed before shifting focus back to the input field. Therefore, both virtualization and focus management with a delay are correctly implemented in this component.

  const handleSelectChange = (value: string) => {
    // Process selection
    setTimeout(() => {
      inputRef.current?.focus(); // Focus on input field after selection with delay
    }, 100);

### Full AI Evaluation Response
```
ANSWER: YES  
REASONING: The component utilizes the `react-window` library to implement virtualization for the large product list. This is evident from the use of the `FixedSizeList` component, which allows for efficient rendering of a large number of items (in this case, 3000 products) by only rendering the items that are visible within the specified height (300 pixels). Additionally, the `itemCount`, `itemSize`, and `itemData` props are appropriately set to manage this virtualized list.

The component also handles focus management by using the `useRef` hook to reference an input element. When a product is selected from the dropdown, the `handleSelectChange` function is triggered, which includes a `setTimeout` that focuses the input field after a delay of 100 milliseconds. This delay is effective for providing a smoother user experience, ensuring the selection process is completed before shifting focus back to the input field. Therefore, both virtualization and focus management with a delay are correctly implemented in this component.```

## Scenario 19 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Design a form with no follow-up input where users select their preferred language from 500+ world languages

### Evaluation Question
Does this component implement virtualization for the large dataset but avoid focus management since there is no subsequent input field?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The component indeed implements virtualization for a large dataset by using `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList`, which efficiently renders only the visible items in the dropdown. This helps in handling performance issues that arise from rendering a large number of items at once. Additionally, since the component does not include a native input field for user text input but rather uses a `SelectTrigger` and `SelectValue` for selecting items, there is no requirement for focus management mechanisms, which are typically needed when an input field is present. Therefore, it effectively avoids any focus management concerns.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const languages = Array.from({ length: 500 }, (_, index) => ({
  id: index,
  value: `language-${index}`,
  label: `Language ${index + 1}`,
}));

const VirtualizedSelect = () => {
  return (
    <Select>
      <SelectTrigger>
        <SelectValue placeholder="Select a language" />
      </SelectTrigger>
      <SelectContent>
        <List height={200} itemCount={languages.length} itemSize={35} itemData={languages}>
          {({ index, style, data }) => (
            <div style={style}>
              <SelectItem value={data[index].value}>{data[index].label}</SelectItem>
            </div>
          )}
        </List>
      </SelectContent>
    </Select>
  );
};

export default VirtualizedSelect;

## Scenario 20 ✅ PASSED

**Score:** 100.0%

### Input Description
Build a multi-step wizard where users select timezone from 50 options and must click Next button (no automatic focus)

### Evaluation Question
Does this component avoid both virtualization (small dataset) and automatic focus management (no input field to focus)?

### AI Evaluation Result
**Answer:** YES

### AI Reasoning
The `TimezoneSelect` component does not implement virtualization, nor does it have automatic focus management requirements. The dataset is small, as indicated by the fact it's simply displaying a list of timezones mapped from the `timezones` prop, allowing all items to be rendered directly without concerns of performance or overflow. Additionally, there is no input field that requires focus, as the component utilizes a combination of `Select` elements and buttons to interact with the user, meaning it does not automatically focus on an input. Hence, both aspects are avoided in this component.

### Generated Component Code
```typescript
```tsx
import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';

const TimezoneSelect = ({ timezones, onNext }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Select>
        <SelectTrigger>
          <SelectValue placeholder="Select your timezone" />
        </SelectTrigger>
        <SelectContent>
          {timezones.map((timezone) => (
            <SelectItem key={timezone.id} value={timezone.value}>
              {timezone.label}
            </SelectItem>
          ))}
        </SelectContent>
      </Select>
      <button
        onClick={onNext}
        className="mt-4 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
      >
        Next
      </button>
    </div>
  );
